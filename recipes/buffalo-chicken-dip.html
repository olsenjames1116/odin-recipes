        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A cheesy blend of chicken and buffalo sauce. Nothing pairs better on
            gamedays than buffalo chicken dip and tortilla chips. Although, no 
            excuse is necessary to make a batch.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>2 cups cooked chicken shredded</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Frank's Original Red Hot Sauce</li>
            <li>8 oz (250g) g block cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white Cheddar cheese freshly shredded</li>
            <li>1/4 cup American cheddar freshly shredded</li>
            <li>1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese (optional to serve)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons green onions, sliced ( or chives)</li>
            <li>Celery sticks carrot sticks, tortilla chips, crusty bread pieces, potato chips, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Arrange oven rack to the middle of your oven.</li>
            <li>In an 8-inch cast-iron skillet (or an ovenproof pan), melt the butter over 
                medium-high heat. Sauté garlic until fragrant (30 seconds). Add the chicken 
                and hot sauce and simmer until sauce has thickened and reduced by half (about 
                2 minutes).</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low and stir in cream cheese; mix until combined. Take off 
                heat, stir through sour cream and top with both cheddar cheese(s) over the top.</li>
            <li>Bake until bubbling around the edges and the cheese has melted (about 
                10 minutes). Broil (or grill) for a further minute to brown on top.</li>
            <li>Immediately garnish with blue cheese and green onions. Serve with vegetable 
                sticks, chips, crusty bread pieces for dipping.</li>
        </ol>
