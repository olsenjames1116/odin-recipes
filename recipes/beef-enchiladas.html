        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A delicious version of the popular Mexican dish. These enchiladas are 
            a mixture of beef and refried beans, wrapped in tortillas, and baked 
            under layers of cheese and red sauce. Sub these out for your typical
            taco night using similar ingredients but a lot more flavor!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp cumin powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 tsp chili seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic minced</li>
            <li>1 lb ground beef (80/20)</li>
            <li>2 cups refried beans (See Note 3)</li>
            <li>4 cups red enchilada sauce</li>
            <li>8 flour tortillas</li>
            <li>8 oz shredded Monterey Jack cheese or Pepper Jack</li>
            <li>chopped cilantro for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl whisk together the spices and set aside. Preheat oven to 350°F.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add onion, cook for 2 minutes. 
                Add garlic and cook another minute.</li>
            <li>Add ground beef, spices and cook for 2 minutes, breaking up meat as it browns. 
                Add refried beans and stir to combine. Cook for 2-3 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Pour some of the enchilada sauce to cover bottom of 13x9″ baking dish.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/3 cup of ground beef filling horizontally across the center of a tortilla, 
                keeping the filling close to each edge. Next, bring the bottom half of the tortilla 
                up and over the top of the filling. Then roll the enchilada up into a nice package. 
                TIP: Don't roll the enchilada up too tightly or the tortilla could tear.</li>
            <li>Place the rolled enchilada seam side down into the sauce on the bottom of the 
                casserole dish. Repeat until 8 nice sized ground beef enchiladas are in the pan.</li>
            <li>Top with the remaining enchilada sauce and shredded Monterey jack cheese and 
                cover with aluminum foil to bake 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove foil and bake another 10 minutes uncovered. Serve with chopped cilantro 
                sprinkled on top.</li>
        </ol>
